- ### Compute services ###
  -**EC2**- Elastic Compute cloud
  
  -**ECS(Elastic conatiner services)/EKS** for conatiner services
 
   -**lambda**- serverless (serverless means cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources)

    -**Fargate**- a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine p that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. it is compatible with both ECS and EKS.
