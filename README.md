- ### Hybrid cloud ###
   - Both public and private cloud
   - shared security responsiblity
- ### Cloud service model ###
  1. **IAAS**- Infrastructure as a service
  2. **PAAS**- Platform as a service
  3. **SAAS**- Software as a seervice

# AWS( AMAZON WEB SERVICES)
A cloud computing platform that offers on-demand computing services such as virtual servers and storage that can be used to build and run applications and websites

- ### Compute services ###
  -**EC2**- Elastic Compute cloud
  
  -**ECS(Elastic conatiner services)/EKS** for conatiner services
 
   -**lambda**- serverless (serverless means cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources)

    -**Fargate**- a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine p that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. it is compatible with both ECS and EKS.

- ### Storage Services ###
   - **S3** Simple storage service
   - **EBS**Elastic Block store
   - **EFS**elastic file system
   - **glacier** Archival storage (cheapest storage service with no instant data pickup)
